                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Sharon Lee and I'm a self-taught User Experience Designer who is passionate about creating digital interfaces that will excite and motivate users to use them.</p>
                    <p>I've been working in IT at a global corporation for almost two years. And one complaint I often come by is, "Why are our enterprise applications so difficult to use?" This complaint has been the major starting point for my passion in user experience. I've seen numerous mistakes happen just because of poorly designed interfaces. There are people out there who spend the majority of their days doing work on old, confusing software. So my goal is to modernize those to make them look and feel great to the user. Without a clean and intuitive interface, a product has little meaning because it won't be used properly or to its fullest potential. We are in a new generation of technology now, and dated software systems need to move forward with the times. This is where I come in.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides designing, I'm also a music educator and performer with a degree in Violin Performance from the University of Michigan. Teaching music is my other passion outside of creating great user experiences. I'm proud of my studio of state-recognized violin champs!</p>
